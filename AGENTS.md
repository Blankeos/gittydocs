# AGENTS

This project is maintained by humans and AI.

When making changes, treat the official docs as the source of truth for how the system should work.

Source of truth:
- `docs/`

If implementation details diverge from the docs, update the code to match the docs, or update the docs first to reflect the intended behavior.
