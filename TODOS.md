- [ ] clear distinct approaches:
  - [ ] out-of-the-box setup
    - [ ] Better packaging (i.e. binarify the web project, only add the .env and the config, we're good)
    - [ ] Possibly a CLI for this at this point?
  - [ ] ejectable setup
- [ ] AI-friendliness:
  - [ ] A clear llms.txt endpoint + an llms.txt, add it as a new feature called automatic llms.txt.
  - [ ] A 1-shot prompt.
- [ ] Hot reload during development.
- [ ] Theming
- [ ] An AI skill / just reusing llms.txt
- [ ] Customize:
  - [ ] The logo
  - [ ] The github url
- [ ] Refactor:
  - [ ] Collocate all gittydocs files into a folder so when ejecting, it's very easy to see where gittydocs is.
