Progress (current state)
- SolidJS/Vike docs shell is in place with header, sidebar, ToC, footer, and mobile layout.
- GitHub runtime fetching works: config load, file tree listing, raw file fetch, edit/issues links.
- Auto-nav generation and title/heading parsing are implemented.
- Search is wired with FlexSearch and a modal UI.
- Viewer route and landing page exist for pasting GitHub URLs.

Needs more work (relative to updated PRD)
- Replace runtime GitHub fetching with build-time source resolution and static output.
- Switch to Velite-based MDX rendering using the pattern in `/Users/carlo/Desktop/Projects/email-thing/apps/landing`.
- Remove the public viewer UI and /gh route; no runtime URL input.
- Consolidate env to a single `GITTYDOCS_SOURCE` that accepts GitHub URL or local path.
- Build-time auto-discovery of docs root, config parsing, and static search index generation.
- Add base-path handling for GitHub Pages and a short workflow template.
- Document Cloudflare Pages deploy and the degit template flow.

THIS IS ALSO OUTDATED
