# The Art of Coffee Brewing

Welcome to the world of specialty coffee. This guide covers everything from bean selection to brewing techniques.

## Understanding Coffee Beans

Coffee beans are actually seeds from the Coffea plant. The two main species are:

- **Arabica** - Grown at high altitudes, known for complex flavors
- **Robusta** - Higher caffeine content, often used in espresso blends

### Processing Methods

1. **Washed/Wet Process** - Clean, bright acidity
2. **Natural/Dry Process** - Fruity, heavy body
3. **Honey Process** - Balance between the two

## Brewing Methods

### Pour Over

Requires:
- Gooseneck kettle
- Burr grinder
- Scale
- Timer

**Steps:**
1. Heat water to 200°F (93°C)
2. Grind 20g coffee to medium-fine
3. Bloom with 40g water for 30 seconds
4. Pour remaining 300g in slow circles
5. Total brew time: 3-4 minutes

### French Press
