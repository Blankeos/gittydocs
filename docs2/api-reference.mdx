# Coffee Equipment Maintenance

Proper maintenance extends equipment life and ensures consistent coffee quality.

## Grinder Maintenance

### Burr Grinders

**Daily:**
- Brush out residual grounds
- Wipe hopper with dry cloth

**Weekly:**
- Run grinder cleaner pellets (Grindz)
- Remove burrs and brush clean

**Monthly:**
- Deep clean with compressed air
- Check burr alignment
- Replace if chipped or dull

### Blade Grinders

- Clean after each use
- Never wash with water
- Replace when blades dull (typically 1-2 years)

## Espresso Machine Care

### Daily Routine

**Backflushing:**
1. Insert blind basket
2. Run pump for 10 seconds
3. Release pressure
4. Repeat 5 times
5. Rinse thoroughly

**Steam Wand:**
- Purge before and after use
- Wipe immediately with damp cloth
- Soak in cleaning solution weekly

### Monthly Tasks

- Descale according to water hardness
- Replace group head gasket
- Clean water reservoir
- Check pressure gauge calibration

## Pour Over Equipment

### Chemex

- Hand wash with mild soap
- Never use abrasive scrubbers
- Dry completely before storage

### V60 / Kalita Wave

- Rinse after each use
- Deep clean weekly
- Check for cracks or warping

### Gooseneck Kettle

- Descale monthly
- Never heat empty
- Check for mineral buildup in spout

## Water Quality

Coffee is 98% water. Poor water ruins good coffee.

### Ideal Parameters

- **TDS:** 75-250 ppm
- **pH:** 6.5-7.5
- **Chlorine:** 0 ppm

### Filtration Options

- **Carbon filter** - Removes chlorine
- **Reverse osmosis** - Too pure, needs remineralization
- **Third wave water** - Pre-measured minerals

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| Sour espresso | Under-extraction | Grind finer, increase dose |
| Bitter espresso | Over-extraction | Grind coarser, decrease dose |
| Weak pour over | Wrong ratio | Use 1:16 coffee to water |
| Grinder jam | Oily beans | Clean burrs, use lighter roast |
