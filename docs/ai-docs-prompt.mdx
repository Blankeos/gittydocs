If you have an existing project and you want to write docs for it very quickly. Try this 1-shot prompt to draft something up!

Copy and paste this prompt into any AI agent running in your repo:

```md
Add docs to my current project using gittydocs with only a `gittydocs.jsonc` and a bunch of `.mdx` files and subfolders for topics.

Analyze this current project first on what can be added to the docs.

For specific references, follow configuration instructions in https://gittydocs.carlo.tl/llms.txt
```
