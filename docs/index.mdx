Create a `docs` folder in your repo:

// docs/gittydocs.jsonc
{
  "site": {
    "name": "My Project",
    "repo": {
      "owner": "yourusername",
      "name": "yourrepo",
      "ref": "main",
      "docsPath": "docs",
    },
  },
}
```

Add a page (i.e. `docs/index.mdx`):

```mdx
---
title: Welcome

# Welcome
