## Local Source (Recommended)

If `GITTYDOCS_SOURCE` points at a folder in this repo, build then deploy `./dist/client`.

### Via Netlify (no token needed)

Connect the repo in Netlify, then set:

- Build Command: `npx gittydocs@latest build "./docs"`
- Publish Directory: `dist/client`

If your docs folder isn't `docs/`, update the build path.

### GitHub Actions (optional)

Generate a workflow:

```bash
npx gittydocs@latest deploy --netlify
```

This writes `.github/workflows/deploy-gittydocs.yml`.

Required GitHub Actions secrets:

- `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`
- `NETLIFY_SITE_ID`

Generated workflow:

```yaml
name: Deploy Gittydocs (Netlify)
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
      - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v2
      - run: npx gittydocs@latest build "./docs"
      - run: npx netlify-cli@latest deploy --dir="./dist/client" --prod
        env:
          NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN }}
          NETLIFY_SITE_ID: ${{ secrets.NETLIFY_SITE_ID }}
```

## Public GitHub URL

You usually won't deploy this way unless you have a redeploy trigger. When the docs repo updates, the site needs a rebuild.

Example redeploy hook (from the docs repo):

```yaml
name: Trigger site deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  notify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: curl -X POST "${{ secrets.DEPLOY_HOOK_URL }}"
```
