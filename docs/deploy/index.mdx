## Deploy sources

### via local source (same repo, recommended)

`gittydocs build` produces a static client bundle in `dist/client` (via Vike).
That output is compatible with any static host, so the provider guides below
are examples, not requirements.

- [GitHub Pages](/deploy/github-pages)
- [Vercel](/deploy/vercel)
- [Cloudflare Pages](/deploy/cloudflare)
- [Netlify](/deploy/netlify)

### via public github url

You usually won't deploy this way unless you have a redeploy trigger. When the
docs repo updates, the site needs a rebuild.

Example redeploy hook (from the docs repo):

```yaml
name: Trigger site deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  notify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: curl -X POST "${{ secrets.DEPLOY_HOOK_URL }}"
```

## Ejected deployments

If you're serving an ejected version, you're simply deploying a Vike + SolidJS app.
Follow those docs and examples here: https://github.com/Blankeos/vike-deploy-examples

Ejected deployments mean you're okay maintaining and updating your docs
independently, since they can diverge significantly from the original.
