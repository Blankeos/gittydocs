## Local Source (Recommended)

If `GITTYDOCS_SOURCE` points at a folder in this repo, build then deploy `./dist/client`.

### GitHub Actions (required for Pages)

Generate a workflow:

```bash
npx gittydocs@latest deploy --ghpages
```

This writes `.github/workflows/deploy-gittydocs.yml`.

Generated workflow:

```yaml
name: Deploy Gittydocs (GitHub Pages)
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
permissions:
  contents: read
  pages: write
  id-token: write
jobs:
  deploy:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: 20
      - uses: oven-sh/setup-bun@v2
      - run: npx gittydocs@latest build "./docs"
      - uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ./dist/client
      - uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

If your docs folder isn't `docs/`, update the build path in the workflow.

Enable GitHub Pages in repo settings -> Pages -> Source: GitHub Actions.

## Public GitHub URL

You usually won't deploy this way unless you have a redeploy trigger. When the docs repo updates, the site needs a rebuild.

Example redeploy hook (from the docs repo):

```yaml
name: Trigger site deploy
on:
  push:
    branches: [main]
jobs:
  notify:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: curl -X POST "${{ secrets.DEPLOY_HOOK_URL }}"
```
