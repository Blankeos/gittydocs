# Getting Started

gittydocs makes it easy to turn your GitHub documentation into a beautiful, searchable docs site.

## Two Ways to Use gittydocs

### 1. Viewer Mode (Easiest)

Just visit `gittydocs.dev/gh/{owner}/{repo}/{ref}/{docs-path}` to view any public repository's documentation.

No setup required! Perfect for:
- Quickly viewing docs without cloning
- Sharing documentation with others
- Previewing changes in PRs

### 2. Self-Hosted Mode

Deploy your own instance for:
- Custom domains
- Private repositories
- Full control over the experience

## Setting Up Self-Hosted

### Step 1: Fork the Repository

Fork the gittydocs repository to your own GitHub account.

### Step 2: Configure Environment Variables

Set these environment variables in your deployment platform:

| Variable | Description | Required |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| `GITHUB_OWNER` | Repository owner | Yes |
| `GITHUB_REPO` | Repository name | Yes |
| `GITHUB_REF` | Branch or tag (default: `main`) | No |
| `DOCS_PATH` | Path to docs folder | No |
| `GITHUB_TOKEN` | GitHub token for private repos | No |

### Step 3: Deploy

Deploy to Vercel, Cloudflare Pages, or any static hosting platform.
